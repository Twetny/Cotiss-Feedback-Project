# Cotiss-Feedback-Project
Real World Project as part of the NextWork Summer of AWS 2022 Program.

## About the Project
Over the summer of 2022/2023, I was a part of [Nextwork](https://www.nextwork.org/)'s Summer of AWS program where other like-minded people sought their AWS cloud practitioner certification. With this program, we split into groups of 2 and developed a website which stored user responses and displayed previous responses back to the user. This was done all using AWS. We were given a real world client with documentation which outlined requirements for our website and the timeframe which we had to achieve it in. Our client for this project was [Cotiss](https://www.cotiss.com/). 

You can find the technical documentation [here](https://github.com/Twetny/Cotiss-Feedback-Project/blob/main/WebApp-Files/CotissFeedbackDocumentation.pdf) which shows the AWS implementation with varying difficulty levels and how to set up the AWS environment for each of the levels.
